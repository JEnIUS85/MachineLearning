# MachineLearning
Contains my attempts of :
a) learning and building machine learning programs
or 
b) learning and understanding algorithms.

I will be updating this repostiory, as and when i build/code something.

Everyone welcome to use my programs ,if you like :)

                  Backtracking Vs Forward Chaining.
************************************************************************************
i see Forward Chaining tacking more time than backtracking for solving N-Queen problem (where N is a big number). Ex: for a matrix of size 30x30, Backtracking able to provide answer in 25 sec where it took over 30min for forward chaining.

May be by adding heuristic techiniques with forward chaining may speed up the solution.
